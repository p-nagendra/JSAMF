I've changed amf.js to allow encoding of objects. I've also fixed some bugs in the decoding process.


At the moment, firefox is the only browser that can encode and decode correctly.

Chrome fails to encode binary strings. bytes over 0xC0 decode to double UTF characters
  Chrome team is working on blobBulder to correct this. It should be fixed soon

Safari behaves in the same way. A blob builder is needed.

IE also can't encode binary strings. ActiveX controlls that would make this possible are now disabled.
 IE can't post binary data too. This is why there's a gateway.swf



Due to the nature of the fall back gateway, I decided to cut my losses and use JSON.
